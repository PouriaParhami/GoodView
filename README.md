Android software to display WordPress sites that use REST APIs

## How to use it
After downloading the source code and creating an APK, 
you can enter the full URL of your WordPress website by going to the menu item - Settings.

***Note:*** rest api is different from sites that use woocommerce. And this software does not support them.
If you use this software to display these sites, their weblog content will be displayed.

## Software features
- Save favorite posts
- Set font size for descriptions, headlines and content
- See and select the desired site categories
- Sharing content or desired post link
- Every 30 minutes, check the site and notify you if a new post has been posted
